C + VI = 106
===============================================================================


Thanks/credit to Shawn Zwach for this challenge!

This challenge is designed with our fantastic 150 students in mind again, and
still only requires basic C knowledge to complete. Your program will read from
stdin until input stops. Each line will contain two integers represented by
Roman numerals (subtractive notation) separated by an operator for addition(+),
subtraction(-), or multiplication(*). There may be any number of leading or
trailing spaces surrounding the numbers. For each line of input, you must print
one line of output with the result of the operation as a number followed by a
new line. Once all operations are completed, print the sum of the result of all
ops followed by a newline. The largest integer you must handle on either side
of an operator is 300. There will be at most 100 lines of input.


Example
===============================================================================

If your program reads the input:

XXIX * III
   CXL - IX
CCVII + VII
 X + X
    II *III
 IV - V

It should output:

87
131
214
20
6
-1
