Postfix (RPN) Calculator
=================================================


From Wikipedia...

Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation in which every
operator follows all of its operands ... for instance, to add 3 and 4, one
would write "3 4 +" rather than "3 + 4". If there are multiple operations,
the operator is given immediately after its second operand; so the expression
written "3 - 4 + 5" in conventional notation would be written "3 4 - 5 +"
in RPN: 4 is first subtracted from 3, then 5 added to it.

=================================================

Your task is to write a program that solves RPN expressions. These expressions
will be given to the program on STDIN (user input), one-per-line, seperated by
a single newline character (\n).  They will only contain single-digit numbers
(i.e. 0-9, nothing larger), but may be of arbitrary length and complexity. Your
program should read each in, and then output a single integer and a newline as
a result.  It must handle five operators: + , -, *, /, %. That is, addition,
subtraction, multiplication, integer division, and modulo.

For example, if your program read in...

62+
92-8+
57+9-34*+7%
78+99*+3/

Then it should output...

8
15
1
32
